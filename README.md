# L-Curve-Visualizer
A simple L System visualizer based on Javascript and D3.  You can see it in action [here](http://lsystem.bitballoon.com/?axiom~-f&r1~f=f+f-f-f+f&r2~&r3~&angle~90&iterations~4&delay~0&system-name~Koch%20Curve)!

### Featuring
* multiple rules
* previous position recall
* multiple colors
* animation

### How to use
Everything you need is in the repo.  It contains a CDN link to both jQuery and D3, so if you're having problems check those declarations.

Feel free to take the code and customize it as you see fit.  Deploy it however and wherever you want, all I ask is a link back to the original repo somewhere in the app.  One thing I'm thinking about adding is line-weight control, which would go along way to making the plant graphs look more impressive.  There are also very interesting takes on the grammar that went beyond the scope of what I was trying to achieve, that you can check out in the book [The Algorithmic Beauty of Plants](http://algorithmicbotany.org/papers/abop/abop-ch1.lowquality.pdf) (warning, PDF link) starting on page 30.  You could even take the basic idea and move it into 3D with little trouble, though the renderer will need to be overhauled.

Whatever you do, have fun with it!  L systems are fascinating and worth experimenting with.
